##Today's Code Challenge!

**1.** Create a file called `freak_out.rb`. You can create this in terminal by entering `touch freak_out.rb`

**2.**Your program could ask for a user’s name and age, and returns a string that says, “OMG! NO WAY. GET OUT OF TOWN. Are you `user_name? You’re user_age years old. I’m your_age years old! That means we’re only difference_in_ages` years apart!!!”


###BONUS:

For those of you who have been here before or are looking for something a little tougher try this problem from Project Euler:

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13. What is the 10,001st prime number?
